# PudUI

I recommend you set your font to **Segoe UI Semibold** under Options > General

This is a WIP

## ToDo
- Finish re-skinning non-HUD windows(windows like Inventory, the AA window, etc).
- Redo bag windows
- Redo inventory window
- Minor layout tweaks for all non-HUD windows
- Fix all UI errors (they exist in the default UI as well)
- Make changes and tweaks based of play testing and feedback

### Pet Window

The pet window uses the aggro meter window to display health bars, while only buffs remain in the pet window itself. Hotbar 10 is resized to use for pet buttons. You can arrange these to your preference.

[Need updated preview]
